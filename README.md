# AdaMatch-pytorch
A PyTorch implementation of [AdaMatch: A Unified Approach to Semi-Supervised Learning and Domain Adaptation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.04732).

This implementation is heavily based off of [Sayak Paul](https://github.com/sayakpaul)'s excellent [keras blog post](https://keras.io/examples/vision/adamatch/).
